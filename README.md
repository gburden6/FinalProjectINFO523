Repository for INFO 523 Final Project on KNN

This repository contains a script for for analyzing the Letter Recognition
data set from the UCI repository

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition


The code contains multiple KNN models, each with varying parameters. 
as a caution, the dataset has 20000 observations. 
Any models run with multiple values of K in tuneGrid or tuneLength
will take several minutes, up to 20+ for 100 or more distinct K's.
